Specifics about the Infrastructure:
Server: The physical or virtual machine that hosts the web infrastructure, responsible for processing requests and generating responses.

Domain Name: A human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address. It enables users to access the website using www.foobar.com.

www Record: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record that points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It specifies that www.foobar.com is an alias for the domain's root domain (foobar.com).

Web Server: Nginx handles incoming HTTP requests, serving static content, and forwarding dynamic requests to the application server for processing.

Application Server: This server runs the application code, processes dynamic requests, communicates with the database, and generates dynamic content for the website.

Database: MySQL is used to store and manage data for the website, providing a structured and efficient way to organize and retrieve information.


Communication with User's Computer:
When the user accesses www.foobar.com, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
The request is received by the web server, which processes static content or forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
The application server interacts with the MySQL database if necessary and generates an HTTP response.
The response is sent back to the user's computer, which renders the website in the user's web browser.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since there's only one server, if it fails, the entire website will be inaccessible.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
When performing maintenance tasks such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, causing downtime during the restart process.

3. Scalability Issues:
The infrastructure cannot easily handle a large influx of incoming traffic. If the website experiences a sudden increase in visitors, it might become slow or unresponsive.
