The Die Is Cast
Traditionally Iacta alea est has been translated into “the die is cast” and used as a way of indicating that something has passed a point of no return, or that you have made your move and that things are now out of your hands and there is no turning back.

Some 300 years after Caesar’s exclamation we find a version of the phrase with Ammianus Marcellinus (330–400 A.D.): “aleam periculorum omnium iecit abrupte” (Amm., XXVI, xii) i.e. “hazarded at one cast all perils” that illustrates this perfectly. 

However, it can be argued that other translations would suit better.

Game Or Die
As Caesar uttered these words the point of no return had not yet been reached, he had not yet made his move, because he said Iacta alea est BEFORE he crossed the river, not afterward. 

To be fair, the decision had been made.
